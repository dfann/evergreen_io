            'It was delivery day for my first data project at Flatiron Health. I was going through the step by step instructions for delivery. There was a section in the instructions that seemed out of place but I followed it anyway. Turns out that section wasn’t updated and running through that step caused the data deliverable to be corrupted. We needed to deliver today and I spent all day working with the data analyst on our team to recreate the deliverable. We were able to recreate the deliverable at 7 pm and deliver the project by the end of the business day because the client was on the West Coast. Some people might think it’s not my fault that the documentation was not updated but I learned it doesn’t hurt to ask when you see something that looks off to you. Don’t just blindly follow instructions if something looks weird. Go and get clarification on it.',

        answer:
            "Whenever I mentor or have an intern I always try to display leadership through my actions. For example most new hires are shy about asking questions in big slack channels so I normally make an extra effort to ask any questions I may have in slack channels so they can see that I’m doing it and it’s not a big deal. Sometimes even when they ask me a question I will say that’s a good question. Let's put it in the slack channel and write the question myself in the slack channel for others to answer. Once they see that it’s no big deal to ask a question they get a lot more comfortable with using Slack Channels which is important because open communication is one of the keys to delivering a successful product.",

        answer:
            'At Netsmart we had a 1% client who found a bug in our EHR (electronic health record) that was preventing them from sending out their billing for the month. I was assigned the ticket and I was able to fix the bug, but this client was self-hosted meaning they had our app installed on their personal server and their IT person was out for the day. They understood that this was on them and they needed to wait, but I asked my manager if I could apply the fix. Since we have remote login rights to all self-hosted boxes and it was only a change to frontend Javascript code I could just replace the file on their server and they could hard refresh their browser and do the billing. She asked the client and they agreed so I was able to remote login onto their server and apply the hotfix so they could bill that day.',
